                                                     materials:
                                                     • A bottle of an aqueous germicidal solution
                                                     • One pair of disposable gloves
                                                     • Forceps
                                                     • One biohazard bag with closure
                                                     • One stack or roll of paper towels
                                                     Note: A sharps biohazard container should also be available for the collection of any broken
                                                     material that could cause a cut or puncture wound (e.g. broken glass vial or tube).


                                                     Procedure:
                                                     1. After notifying all employees in the immediate area, collect the biohazard spill kit and
                                                     immediately return to the area.
                                                     2. Put on the disposable gloves, and any other personal protective equipment as dictated by
                                                     regulatory requirements or laboratory procedures.
                                                     3. To avoid injury due to broken material, such as packaging or labware, use the forceps to pick
                                                     up as much material as possible, and carefully place the materials into the sharps biohazard
                                                     container.
                                                     4. Cover area with paper towels to decrease spread of spill and the creation of an aerosol.
                                                     5. Saturate the spill area with germicidal solution. Keep the spill area moist with the germicidal
                                                     solution for the appropriate amount of time as indicated on the germicidal solution used.
                                                     6. Wipe up the area with the paper towels. Place all used paper towels in the biohazard bag.
                                                     7. Following the cleanup, carefully remove the gloves, and place them into the biohazard bag.
                                                     8. Seal the biohazard bag.
