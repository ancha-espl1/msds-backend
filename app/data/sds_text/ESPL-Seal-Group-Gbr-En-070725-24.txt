                                                SAFETY DATA SHEET
             This safety data sheet complies with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006, as amended.

Biological Exposure Indices:
   No biological exposure limits noted for the ingredient(s).

Derived No Effect Level (DNEL): No information available.

Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC): No information available.
8.2 Exposure controls
    Ventilation and engineering measures
                               : Provide adequate ventilation. Apply technical measures to comply with the occupational
                                 exposure limits. Where reasonably practicable this should be achieved by the use of local
                                 exhaust ventilation and good general extraction. In case of insufficient ventilation wear
                                 suitable respiratory equipment.
    Respiratory protection     : Respirator must be worn if exposed to dust. The filter class for the respirator must be
                                 suitable for the maximum expected contaminant concentration
                                 (gas/vapour/aerosol/particulates) that may arise when handling the product. If this
                                 concentration is exceeded, self-contained breathing apparatus must be used.
    Skin protection            : For prolonged skin exposure, gloves impervious to the material are recommended. The
                                 suitability for a specific workplace should be discussed with the producers of the protective
                                 gloves. The selected protective gloves have to satisfy the specifications of EU Directive
                                 89/689/EEC and the standard EN 374 derived from it.
    Eye / face protection      : Wear as appropriate: Safety glasses with side shields; Goggles. See also EN 166.
    Other protective equipment
                                   : Ensure that eyewash stations and safety showers are close to the workstation location.
    General hygiene considerations
                              : Avoid breathing dust. Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Wash thoroughly after
                                 handling. Remove and wash contaminated clothing before re-use. Handle in accordance
                                 with good industrial hygiene and safety practice.

   Routes of exposure            : Eye contact; Skin contact; Inhalation; Ingestion.
   Effects of acute exposure     : Inhalation: High concentrations of dust may cause coughing and mild, temporary irritation.
                                   Inhalation of fumes may result in metal fume fever, a flu-like illness. Symptoms of metal
                                   fume fever may include fever, fatigue, vomiting, muscle aches and shortness of breath.

                                    Skin contact: Direct skin contact may result in little or no irritation. Direct skin contact may
                                    cause temporary redness.

                                    Eye contact: Inert particles may cause mechanical irritation of the eyes, including scratches.
                                    Symptoms may include stinging and tearing.

                                    Ingestion: Ingestion may cause gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.



   Potential Chronic Health Effects
                               : Silver in the form of a finely divided dust may cause discoloration in contact with skin, and
                                  argyrosis in case of inhalation.
   Other important hazards     : None known or reported by the manufacturer.

              This safety data sheet complies with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006, as amended.

SECTION 12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION

12.1 Toxicity                    : No data is available on the product itself. The product should not be allowed to enter drains
                                   or water courses, or be deposited where it can affect ground or surface waters.
                                   Note: Contains: Silver. The acute toxicity of silver to aquatic species varies drastically by the
                                   chemical form and correlates with the availability of free ionic silver. Aquatic toxicity is highly
                                   variable not only by organism but with physical and chemical characteristics of the water
                                   itself.

                                    See the following tables for individual ingredient ecotoxicity data.

                  This safety data sheet complies with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006, as amended.

12.5 Results of PBT and vPvB assessment
                             : This mixture contains no substance considered to be persistent, bioaccumulating nor toxic
                                (PBT).

SECTION 13. DISPOSAL CONSIDERATIONS

13.1 Waste Treatment Methods:
     Handling for Disposal              : Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practice. Refer to protective
                                          measures listed in sections 7 and 8. This material and its container must be disposed of in a
                                          safe way.
     Methods of Disposal                : Empty containers may contain hazardous residues. Since emptied containers may retain
                                          product residue, follow label warnings even after container is emptied.
                                          Dispose of in accordance with the European Directives on waste and hazardous waste.
                                          Waste must be classified and labelled prior to recycling or disposal. According to the
                                          European Waste Catalogue, Waste Codes are not product specific, but application specific.
                                          Waste codes should be assigned by the user based on the application for which the product
                                          was used.
