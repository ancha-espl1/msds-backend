4. FIRST AID MEASURES cont.
Eye Contact: If contact with the eye(s) occur, wash with copious amounts of water, holding eyelid(s) open. If irritation develops,
seek medical attention.
Ingestion: DO NOT induce vomiting. Give a glass of water. Seek immediate medical attention.
Further Medical Treatment: Symptomatic treatment and supportive therapy as indicated.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Classed as flammable. If involved in a fire, it may emit noxious and toxic fumes.
Extinguishing media: Use Foam, CO2, or powder to extinguish fire.
Fire Fighting: Highly flammable liquid. Keep containers cool with water spray. On burning will emit toxic fumes. Fire fighters to
wear self-contained breathing apparatus if risk of exposure to vapour or products of combustion.
Fire/Explosion Hazard: Flammable liquid. Combustion products include oxides of carbon. Keep storage tanks, pipelines, fire
exposed surfaces etc cool with water spray. Shut off any leak if safe to do so and remove sources of re-ignition. Vapour/air mixtures
may ignite explosively and flashback along the vapour trail may occur.

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
Emergency procedures: Remove all sources of ignition. Increase ventilation. Evacuate all unnecessary personnel. Wear full protective
equipment and clothing to minimize exposure. If possible, contain the spill. Place inert, noncombustible, absorbent material onto spillage. Use
clean non-sparking tools to collect the material and place into a suitable labelled container. If large quantities of this material enter the
waterways contact the Environmental Protection Authority, or your local Waste Management Authority.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE
Conditions for safe storage: Highly flammable liquid for storage and handling purposes. Keep tightly closed in a dry, cool, well-
ventilated area, out of direct sunlight. Avoid sparks, flames, and other ignition sources. Store away from incompatible materials. DO
NOT pressurize, cut, heat or weld containers as they may contain hazardous residues. For information on the design of the store-
room reference should be made to Australian Standard AS1940 – The storage and handling of flammable and combustible liquids.
Reference should also be made to all Local, State and Federal Regulations.
Precautions for safe handling: Repeated or prolonged exposure to this material should be avoided to lessen the possibility of
disorders. Use in a well-ventilated area. Prohibit sources of sparks, ignition, and naked flames. Wear appropriate protective equipment.
It is essential that all who encounter this material, maintain high standards of personal hygiene i.e., washing hands prior to eating,
drinking, smoking, or going to the toilet. Buildup of vapour or mist in the working atmosphere must be prevented. Ensure ventilation is
adequate. DO NOT enter confined spaces where vapour or mist may have collected. Keep containers closed when not in use. Prevent
accumulation of static electricity and earth all equipment.
Corrosiveness: Not corrosive to metals.

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION
Occupational Exposure Limits: None established for this product.
Engineering controls: Use only with adequate ventilation. Local exhaust ventilation or flameproof fume cupboards may be necessary
for some operations. Use of closed or semi-closed processes e.g., Lidded tanks can reduce exposure.
Personal Protective Equipment:
Respiratory Protection: Avoid breathing of vapours/mists. Where ventilation is inadequate and vapours/mists are generated, the use of an
approved respirator with filter complying with AS/NZS 1715 and AS/NZS 1716 is recommended; however final choice of appropriate breathing
protection is dependent upon actual airborne concentrations and the type of breathing protection required will vary according to individual
circumstances. Expert advice may be required to make this decision. Reference should be made to Australian Standards AS/NZS 1715-
Selection, Use and Maintenance of Respiratory Protective Devices; and AS/NZS 1716- Respiratory Protective Devices.
Eye Protection: Chemical safety glasses or face shield recommended as appropriate. Final choice of appropriate eye/face protection will
vary according to individual circumstances including methods of handling or engineering controls as determined by appropriate risk
assessments. Eye protection should conform to Australian/New Zealand Standard AS/NZS 1337- Eye Protectors for Industrial Applications.
Hand Protection: Impervious gloves recommended as appropriate. Final choice of appropriate glove type will vary according to
individual circumstances, including methods of handling or engineering controls as determined by appropriate risk assessments.
Refer to AS/NZS 2161 Occupational protective gloves- Selection, use and maintenance.
Other Information: No exposure standards have been established for this material by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission
(NOHSC). However, all exposure should be kept to the least possible levels as over-exposure to any chemical may result in enhancement of pre-
existing adverse medical conditions and/or allergic reactions. Exposure standards for individual constituents are listed above.
