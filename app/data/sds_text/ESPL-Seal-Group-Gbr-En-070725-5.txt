SECTION 2: Hazards identification
2.1. Classification of the substance or mixture
     The mixture has been assessed and/or tested for its physical, health and environmental hazards and the following classification
     applies.
Classification according to Directive 67/548/EEC or 1999/45/EC as amended
    This preparation does not meet the criteria for classification according to Directive 1999/45/EC as amended.
Classification according to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 as amended
    This mixture does not meet the criteria for classification according to Regulation (EC) 1272/2008 as amended.
Hazard summary
   Physical hazards                 Not classified for physical hazards.
    Health hazards                  Occupational exposure to the substance or mixture may cause adverse health effects.
    Environmental hazards           Not classified for hazards to the environment.
    Specific hazards                When heated above 150°C in air, may release formaldehyde gas.
    Main symptoms                   May be mildly irritating to skin, eyes and respiratory system. Exposure may cause temporary
                                    irritation, redness, or discomfort.
                                    Inhalation of fumes may result in metal fume fever, a flu-like illness. Symptoms of metal fume
                                    fever may include fever, fatigue, vomiting, muscle aches and shortness of breath.
                                    Ingestion may cause gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
                                    Avoid heating, which will result in the liberation of formaldehyde gas. Formaldehyde is an eye and
                                    throat irritant and acute toxicant. Formaldehyde may cause sensitisation by skin contact.
                                    Formaldehyde has shown limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect.

SECTION 4: First aid measures
General information                   Ensure that medical personnel are aware of the material(s) involved, and take precautions to
                                      protect themselves. Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance.
4.1. Description of first aid measures
     Inhalation                    If inhaled, remove to fresh air. If breathing is difficult, trained personnel should give oxygen. If
                                   breathing stops, provide artificial respiration. When symptoms persist or in all cases of doubt, seek
                                   medical advice.
     Skin contact                  Wash off immediately with soap and plenty of water while removing all contaminated clothes and
                                   shoes. When symptoms persist or in all cases of doubt, seek medical advice. Wash contaminated
                                   clothing before reuse.
     Eye contact                   Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids. When symptoms persist or in all
                                   cases of doubt, seek medical advice.
     Ingestion                     Do NOT induce vomiting. Never give anything by mouth to a victim who is unconscious or is
                                   having convulsions. When symptoms persist or in all cases of doubt, seek medical advice.

8.2. Exposure controls
Appropriate engineering             Ensure adequate ventilation, especially in confined areas. Good general ventilation (typically 10 air
controls                            changes per hour) should be used. Ventilation rates should be matched to conditions. In case of
                                    insufficient ventilation, wear suitable respiratory equipment.
Individual protection measures, such as personal protective equipment
    General information          Personal protection equipment should be chosen according to the CEN standards and in
                                 discussion with the supplier of the personal protective equipment.
    Eye/face protection          If product is processed in a manner that generates dusts or fumes, wear as appropriate: Safety
                                 glasses. Tight fitting safety goggles. See also EN 166.
                                 Eye wash fountain is recommended.
     Skin protection
     - Hand protection              Gloves impervious to the material are recommended. The suitability for a specific workplace
                                    should be discussed with the producers of the protective gloves. The selected protective gloves
                                    have to satisfy the specifications of EU Directive 89/689/EEC and the standard EN 374 derived
                                    from it.
     - Other                        Wear suitable protective clothing.
                                    Eye wash facilities and emergency shower must be available when handling this product.
     Respiratory protection         In case of insufficient ventilation, wear suitable respiratory equipment. The filter class for the
                                    respirator must be suitable for the maximum expected contaminant concentration
                                    (gas/vapour/aerosol/particulates) that may arise when handling the product. Seek advice from
                                    respiratory protection specialists.
     Thermal hazards                Wear appropriate thermal protective clothing, when necessary.
Hygiene measures                    Avoid breathing dust. Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. Remove soiled clothing and wash
                                    it thoroughly before reuse. Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practices.
Environmental exposure              Environmental manager must be informed of all major releases.

SECTION 11: Toxicological information
General information                  Occupational exposure to the substance or mixture may cause adverse effects.
Information on likely routes of exposure
    Inhalation                     Mild respiratory irritant.
    Skin contact                     Direct skin contact may cause slight or mild, transient irritation.
    Eye contact                      Direct contact with eyes may cause temporary irritation.
    Ingestion                        May cause irritation of the gastrointestinal tract.
Symptoms                             May be mildly irritating to skin, eyes and respiratory system. Exposure may cause temporary
                                     irritation, redness, or discomfort.
                                     Inhalation of fumes may result in metal fume fever, a flu-like illness. Symptoms of metal fume
                                     fever may include fever, fatigue, vomiting, muscle aches and shortness of breath.
                                     Ingestion may cause gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
                                     Avoid heating, which will result in the liberation of formaldehyde gas. Formaldehyde causes
                                     severe respiratory irritation, lung inflammation and pulmonary edema. Formaldehyde gas causes
                                     moderate to severe eye irritation. Formaldehyde may cause sensitisation by skin contact.
                                     Formaldehyde has shown limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect.

SECTION 13: Disposal considerations
13.1. Waste treatment methods
Residual waste                     Dispose of in accordance with local regulations. Empty containers or liners may retain some
                                   product residues. This material and its container must be disposed of in a safe manner (see:
                                   Disposal instructions).
Contaminated packaging             Empty containers should be taken to an approved waste handling site for recycling or disposal.
                                   Since emptied containers may retain product residue, follow label warnings even after container is
                                   emptied.
EU waste code                      The Waste code should be assigned in discussion between the user, the producer and the waste
                                   disposal company.
Disposal methods/information       Collect and reclaim or dispose in sealed containers at licensed waste disposal site.
