Section 4. First aid measures
Description of necessary first aid measures
 Eye contact                     : Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water, occasionally lifting the upper and lower
                                   eyelids. Check for and remove any contact lenses. Get medical attention if irritation
                                   occurs.
 Inhalation                      : Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. Get
                                   medical attention if symptoms occur.
 Skin contact                    : Flush contaminated skin with plenty of water. Remove contaminated clothing and

 personnel                  Evacuate surrounding areas. Keep unnecessary and unprotected personnel from
                            entering. Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Put on appropriate personal
                            protective equipment.
 For emergency responders : If specialised clothing is required to deal with the spillage, take note of any information
                            in Section 8 on suitable and unsuitable materials. See also the information in "For non-
                            emergency personnel".

Environmental precautions        : Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains
                                   and sewers. Inform the relevant authorities if the product has caused environmental
                                   pollution (sewers, waterways, soil or air).

Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up
 Small spill                 : Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Dilute with water and mop up
                               if water-soluble. Alternatively, or if water-insoluble, absorb with an inert dry material and
                               place in an appropriate waste disposal container. Dispose of via a licensed waste
                               disposal contractor.
 Large spill                 : Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Prevent entry into sewers,
                               water courses, basements or confined areas. Wash spillages into an effluent treatment
                               plant or proceed as follows. Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible,
                               absorbent material e.g. sand, earth, vermiculite or diatomaceous earth and place in
                               container for disposal according to local regulations (see Section 13). Dispose of via a
                               licensed waste disposal contractor. Note: see Section 1 for emergency contact
                               information and Section 13 for waste disposal.

Section 7. Handling and storage
Precautions for safe handling
 Protective measures             : Put on appropriate personal protective equipment (see Section 8).
 Advice on general               : Eating, drinking and smoking should be prohibited in areas where this material is
 occupational hygiene              handled, stored and processed. Workers should wash hands and face before eating,
                                   drinking and smoking. Remove contaminated clothing and protective equipment before
                                   entering eating areas. See also Section 8 for additional information on hygiene
                                   measures.

Conditions for safe storage,     : Store in accordance with local regulations. Store in original container protected from
including any                      direct sunlight in a dry, cool and well-ventilated area, away from incompatible materials
incompatibilities                  and food and drink. Keep container tightly closed and sealed until ready for use.
                                   Containers that have been opened must be carefully resealed and kept upright to
                                   prevent leakage. Do not store in unlabeled containers. Use appropriate containment to
                                   avoid environmental contamination.

Section 8. Exposure controls/personal protection
Control parameters
 Occupational exposure limits
  None.


Appropriate engineering          : Good general ventilation should be sufficient to control worker exposure to airborne
controls                           contaminants.
Environmental exposure           : Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure
controls                           they comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation. In some
                                   cases, fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment
                                   will be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.

Individual protection measures
 Hygiene measures                : Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before
                                   eating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period.
                                   Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.
                                   Wash contaminated clothing before reusing. Ensure that eyewash stations and safety
                                   showers are close to the workstation location.
 Eye/face protection             : Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk
                                   assessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists,
                                   gases or dusts. If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless
                                   the assessment indicates a higher degree of protection: safety glasses with side-
                                   shields.
 Skin protection
  Hand protection                : Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be
                                   worn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is
                                   necessary.
   Body protection               : Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being
                                   performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before
                                   handling this product.
   Other skin protection         : Appropriate footwear and any additional skin protection measures should be selected
                                   based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a
                                   specialist before handling this product.
 Respiratory protection          : Use a properly fitted, air-purifying or air-fed respirator complying with an approved
                                   standard if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary. Respirator selection must be
                                   based on known or anticipated exposure levels, the hazards of the product and the safe
                                   working limits of the selected respirator.

Section 13. Disposal considerations
Disposal methods                       : The generation of waste should be avoided or minimized wherever possible. Disposal
                                         of this product, solutions and any by-products should at all times comply with the
                                         requirements of environmental protection and waste disposal legislation and any
                                         regional local authority requirements. Dispose of surplus and non-recyclable products
                                         via a licensed waste disposal contractor. Waste should not be disposed of untreated to
                                         the sewer unless fully compliant with the requirements of all authorities with jurisdiction.
                                         Waste packaging should be recycled. Incineration or landfill should only be considered
                                         when recycling is not feasible. This material and its container must be disposed of in a
                                         safe way. Empty containers or liners may retain some product residues. Avoid
                                         dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains and
                                         sewers.
