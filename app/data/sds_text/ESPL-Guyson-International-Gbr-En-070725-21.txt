7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Precautions for safe handling                   Fused alumina is not classified and no
                                                protective measures are needed for safe
                                                handling.
                                                Prevent formation of dust.
                                                Use only in well ventilated areas.
                                                Wear personal protective clothing.
                                                Wash hands and face before breaks and
                                                after work.

8. EXPOSURE CONTROL / PERSONAL PROTECTION


Engineering Measures:                           Preferred methods of use are either in a
                                                blast cabinet with a dust collector or in a
                                                closed-circuit blasting system.

                                                If a blast room is used it must have a dust
                                                extraction system to keep dust levels
                                                below the occupational exposure limits.

Occupational Exposure Limits                    All dusts have been assigned exposure
                                                limits. The following information has been
                                                taken from Guidance Note EH40/2005 from
