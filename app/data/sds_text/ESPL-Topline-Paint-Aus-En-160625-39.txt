4. FIRST AID MEASURES
For advice, contact a Poisons Information Centre 131 126 or a doctor.
Inhalation: Remove the source of contamination or move the victim to fresh air. Ensure airways are clear and have a qualified person
give oxygen through facemask if breathing is difficult. Seek immediate medical attention.
Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Wash affected areas with copious amounts of soap and water. Ensure contaminated
clothing is washed before re-use or discard. Seek medical attention.
Eye Contact: If contact with the eye(s) occur, wash with copious amounts of water, holding eyelid(s) open. Take care not to rinse
contaminated water into the non-affected eye. If irritation develops, seek medical attention.
Ingestion: DO NOT induce vomiting. Immediately wash mouth out with water. Seek immediate medical attention.
Further Medical Treatment: Symptomatic treatment and supportive therapy as indicated.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Not classed as flammable. If involved in a fire, it may emit noxious and toxic fumes.
Extinguishing media: Use extinguishing media suitable for surrounding area.

Fire Fighting: Wear breathing apparatus plus protective gloves for fire only. Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering
drains or watercourses. Cool fire exposed containers with water spray from a protected location. DO NOT approach containers
suspected to be hot. Use fire fighting procedures suitable for surrounding area.

Fire/Explosion Hazard: This material is not readily combustible under normal conditions. However, it will break down under fire
conditions and the organic component may burn. Not considered to be a significant fire risk. Heat may cause expansion or
decomposition with violent rupture of containers. Decomposes on heating and may produce toxic fumes of carbon monoxide. May
emit acrid smoke.

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
Emergency procedures: Remove all sources of ignition. Increase ventilation. Evacuate all unnecessary personnel. Wear full
protective equipment and clothing to minimize exposure. If possible, contain the spill.

Methods and materials for containment and clean up: Place inert, noncombustible, absorbent material onto spillage. Use clean
non-sparking tools to collect the material and place into a suitable labelled container. If large quantities of this material enter the
waterways contact the Environmental Protection Authority, or your local Waste Management Authority.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE
Conditions for safe storage: Limit all unnecessary personal contact. Wear protective clothing when risk of exposure occurs. Use in
a well-ventilated area. Avoid contact with incompatible materials. When handling, DO NOT eat, drink, or smoke. Keep containers
securely sealed when not in use. Avoid physical damage to containers. Always wash hands with soap and water after handling. Work
clothes should be cleaned separately. Use in a well-ventilated area.

Precautions for safe handling: Store in original containers. Keep containers securely sealed. Store in a cool, dry, well-ventilated
area. DO NOT allow freeze. Store away from incompatible materials.

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION
Occupational Exposure Limits: No exposure standards have been established for this material by the National Occupational Health
And Safety Commission (NOHSC). However, all exposure should be kept to the least possible levels as over-exposure to any
chemical may result in enhancement of pre-existing adverse medical conditions and/or allergic reactions. Exposure standards for
individual constituents are listed above.

Engineering controls: Ensure ventilation is adequate and that air concentrations of components are controlled below quoted
Exposure Standards. Keep containers closed when not in use. Vapour heavier than air – prevent concentration in hollows or sumps.
DO NOT enter confined spaces where vapour may have collected. Where vapours or mists are generated, particularly in enclosed
areas, and natural ventilation is inadequate, a flameproof exhaust ventilation system is recommended.

Personal Protective Equipment:
Respiratory Protection: Avoid breathing of vapours/mists. Where ventilation is inadequate and vapours/mists are generated, the use
of an approved respirator with filter complying with AS/NZS 1715 and AS/NZS 1716 is recommended; however final choice of
appropriate breathing protection is dependent upon actual airborne concentrations and the type of breathing protection required will
vary according to individual circumstances. Expert advice may be required to make this decision. Reference should be made to
Australian Standards AS/NZS 1715- Selection, Use and Maintenance of Respiratory Protective Devices; and AS/NZS 1716-
Respiratory Protective Devices.
Eye Protection: Chemical safety glasses or face shield recommended as appropriate. Final choice of appropriate eye/face protection will
vary according to individual circumstances including methods of handling or engineering controls as determined by appropriate risk
assessments. Eye protection should conform to Australian/New Zealand Standard AS/NZS 1337- Eye Protectors for Industrial Applications.

Hand Protection: General protective gloves recommended as appropriate. Final choice of appropriate glove type will vary according
to individual circumstances, including methods of handling or engineering controls as determined by appropriate risk assessments.
Refer to AS/NZS 2161 Occupational protective gloves- Selection, use and maintenance.

Other Information: Biological Limit Values: No biological limit allocated.
