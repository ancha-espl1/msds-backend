Section 6. Accidental release measures
Environmental precautions        : Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains
                                   and sewers. Inform the relevant authorities if the product has caused environmental
                                   pollution (sewers, waterways, soil or air). Water polluting material. May be harmful to
                                   the environment if released in large quantities.

Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up
 Small spill                     : Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Use spark-proof tools and
                                   explosion-proof equipment. Dilute with water and mop up if water-soluble. Alternatively,
                                   or if water-insoluble, absorb with an inert dry material and place in an appropriate waste
                                   disposal container. Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor.
 Large spill                     : Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Use spark-proof tools and
                                   explosion-proof equipment. Approach release from upwind. Prevent entry into sewers,
                                   water courses, basements or confined areas. Wash spillages into an effluent treatment
                                   plant or proceed as follows. Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible,
                                   absorbent material e.g. sand, earth, vermiculite or diatomaceous earth and place in
                                   container for disposal according to local regulations (see Section 13). Dispose of via a
                                   licensed waste disposal contractor. Contaminated absorbent material may pose the

controls                           other engineering controls to keep worker exposure to airborne contaminants below any
                                   recommended or statutory limits. The engineering controls also need to keep gas,
                                   vapor or dust concentrations below any lower explosive limits. Use explosion-proof
                                   ventilation equipment.
Environmental exposure           : Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure
controls                           they comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation. In some
                                   cases, fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment
                                   will be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.

Individual protection measures
 Hygiene measures            : Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before
                               eating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period.
                               Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.
                               Wash contaminated clothing before reusing. Ensure that eyewash stations and safety
                               showers are close to the workstation location.
 Eye/face protection         : Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk
                               assessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists,
                               gases or dusts. If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless
                               the assessment indicates a higher degree of protection: chemical splash goggles.
 Skin protection
   Hand protection               : Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be
                                   worn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is
                                   necessary. Considering the parameters specified by the glove manufacturer, check
                                   during use that the gloves are still retaining their protective properties. It should be
                                   noted that the time to breakthrough for any glove material may be different for different
                                   glove manufacturers. In the case of mixtures, consisting of several substances, the
                                   protection time of the gloves cannot be accurately estimated.
   Body protection               : Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being
                                   performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before
                                   handling this product. When there is a risk of ignition from static electricity, wear anti-
                                   static protective clothing. For the greatest protection from static discharges, clothing
                                   should include anti-static overalls, boots and gloves.
   Other skin protection         : Appropriate footwear and any additional skin protection measures should be selected
                                   based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a
                                   specialist before handling this product.
 Respiratory protection          : Use a properly fitted, air-purifying or air-fed respirator complying with an approved
                                   standard if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary. Respirator selection must be
                                   based on known or anticipated exposure levels, the hazards of the product and the safe
                                   working limits of the selected respirator.

Section 13. Disposal considerations
Disposal methods                       : The generation of waste should be avoided or minimized wherever possible. Disposal
                                         of this product, solutions and any by-products should at all times comply with the
                                         requirements of environmental protection and waste disposal legislation and any
                                         regional local authority requirements. Dispose of surplus and non-recyclable products
                                         via a licensed waste disposal contractor. Waste should not be disposed of untreated to
                                         the sewer unless fully compliant with the requirements of all authorities with jurisdiction.
                                         Waste packaging should be recycled. Incineration or landfill should only be considered
                                         when recycling is not feasible. This material and its container must be disposed of in a
                                         safe way. Care should be taken when handling emptied containers that have not been
                                         cleaned or rinsed out. Empty containers or liners may retain some product residues.
                                         Vapor from product residues may create a highly flammable or explosive atmosphere
                                         inside the container. Do not cut, weld or grind used containers unless they have been
                                         cleaned thoroughly internally. Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact
                                         with soil, waterways, drains and sewers.
