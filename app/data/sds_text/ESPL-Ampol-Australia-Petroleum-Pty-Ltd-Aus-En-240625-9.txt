 SECTION 4                                       FIRST AID MEASURES

INHALATION
      Remove from further exposure. For those providing assistance, avoid exposure to yourself or others. Use
      adequate respiratory protection. If respiratory irritation, dizziness, nausea, or unconsciousness occurs, seek
      immediate medical assistance. If breathing has stopped, assist ventilation with a mechanical device or use
      mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

SKIN CONTACT
      Wash contact areas with soap and water. If product is injected into or under the skin, or into any part of the
      body, regardless of the appearance of the wound or its size, the individual should be evaluated immediately by
      a physician as a surgical emergency. Even though initial symptoms from high pressure injection may be
      minimal or absent, early surgical treatment within the first few hours may significantly reduce the ultimate extent
      of injury.

EYE CONTACT
      Flush thoroughly with water.         If irritation occurs, get medical assistance.

INGESTION
      First aid is normally not required. Seek medical attention if discomfort occurs.

NOTE TO PHYSICIAN
      None

FIRE FIGHTING
       Fire Fighting Instructions: Evacuate area. Prevent run-off from fire control or dilution from entering
       streams, sewers or drinking water supply. Fire-fighters should use standard protective equipment and in
       enclosed spaces, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). Use water spray to cool fire exposed surfaces
       and to protect personnel.

        Hazardous Combustion Products:           Aldehydes, Incomplete combustion products, Oxides of carbon, Smoke,
        Fume, Sulphur oxides

FLAMMABILITY PROPERTIES
     Flash Point [Method]: >200°C (392°F) [ASTM D-92]
     Flammable Limits (Approximate volume % in air): LEL:                 0.9      UEL: 7.0
     Autoignition Temperature: N/D


 SECTION 6                                    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES
      In the event of a spill or accidental release, notify relevant authorities in accordance with all applicable
      regulations.

PROTECTIVE MEASURES
     Avoid contact with spilled material. See Section 5 for fire fighting information. See the Hazard Identification
     Section for Significant Hazards. See Section 4 for First Aid Advice. See Section 8 for advice on the minimum
     requirements for personal protective equipment. Additional protective measures may be necessary, depending
     on the specific circumstances and/or the expert judgment of the emergency responders.

        For emergency responders: Respiratory protection: respiratory protection will be necessary only in special
        cases, e.g., formation of mists. Half-face or full-face respirator with filter(s) for dust/organic vapor or Self
        Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) can be used depending on the size of spill and potential level of
        exposure. If the exposure cannot be completely characterized or an oxygen deficient atmosphere is possible
        or anticipated, SCBA is recommended. Work gloves that are resistant to hydrocarbons are recommended.
        Gloves made of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) are not water-resistant and are not suitable for emergency use.
        Chemical goggles are recommended if splashes or contact with eyes is possible. Small spills: normal
        antistatic work clothes are usually adequate. Large spills: full body suit of chemical resistant, antistatic
        material is recommended.

SPILL MANAGEMENT
       Land Spill: Stop leak if you can do so without risk.      Recover by pumping or with suitable absorbent.

        Water Spill: Stop leak if you can do so without risk. Confine the spill immediately with booms. Warn other
        shipping. Remove from the surface by skimming or with suitable absorbents. Seek the advice of a specialist
        before using dispersants.

        Water spill and land spill recommendations are based on the most likely spill scenario for this material;
        however, geographic conditions, wind, temperature, (and in the case of a water spill) wave and current direction
        and speed may greatly influence the appropriate action to be taken. For this reason, local experts should be
        consulted. Note: Local regulations may prescribe or limit action to be taken.

ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS
      Large Spills: Dyke far ahead of liquid spill for later recovery and disposal. Prevent entry into waterways,

        sewers, basements or confined areas.

 SECTION 7                                  HANDLING AND STORAGE

HANDLING
     Avoid contact with used product. Prevent small spills and leakage to avoid slip hazard. Material can accumulate
     static charges which may cause an electrical spark (ignition source). When the material is handled in bulk, an
     electrical spark could ignite any flammable vapors from liquids or residues that may be present (e.g., during
     switch-loading operations). Use proper bonding and/or earthing procedures. However, bonding and earthing
     may not eliminate the hazard from static accumulation. Consult local applicable standards for guidance.
     Additional references include American Petroleum Institute 2003 (Protection Against Ignitions Arising out of
     Static, Lightning and Stray Currents) or National Fire Protection Agency 77 (Recommended Practice on Static
     Electricity) or CENELEC CLC/TR 50404 (Electrostatics - Code of practice for the avoidance of hazards due to
     static electricity).

        Static Accumulator:       This material is a static accumulator.

STORAGE
The type of container used to store the material may affect static accumulation and dissipation. Do not store in open
or unlabelled containers. Keep away from incompatible materials.
